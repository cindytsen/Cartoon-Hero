        <h2>About PookyBear</h2>
        <p>PookyBear is Garfield's sidekick and his bosom buddy for life. He goes where Garfield goes. 
            They go adventures together, keeping company through thick and thin. There will be times that
            PookyBear disappears, but it's for good reason: to be cleaned and go on another adventure! Otherwise,
            there is no day or night that PookyBear is away from Garfield. They like to end their days looking at 
            the stars and just gaze at the stars as though they are mapping out their next destination....in secret.
